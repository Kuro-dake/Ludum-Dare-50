Greetings Gaia, mother of all!
--
Look at your wonderful creation! 
The planet Earth!
--
All the life! All the beauty!
--
But what is this? A monkey! Isn't it cute? <3
--
And look! It has friends!
--
And they invented fire. How ingenious!
--
I know it stings a bit mother, 
but bear with your children. They're just cold.

<size=25><i>Hold WASD keys to heal Gaia. Watch the energy meter (blue cross). When it runs out, you have to wait until it fully regenerates.</i></size>
--
Your children have learned to build houses out of wood!
They are cutting your trees down, but don't worry! They will only take what is necesarry.
--
They learned to till the soil and invented agriculture.
Forgive them for disrupting your land, but they were starving.
--
They did start to overeat as soon as they were able to thought...
--
They have started what they call an industrial era.
They burn a lot of coal, and they are leaving their trash everywhere.

Come on monkeys... Clean up after yourselves! It's not that hard!
--
They are still young. Please have patience.
--
So they started drilling for oil now, and they are burning a lot of it.
Damn monkeys... the smoke is everywhere, and they don't seem to mind one bit.
--
Also they call themselves the crown of creation. 
They sure are into their hype a lot.
--
Oh god what now? 
--
Oh it's nothing. They're just using their advancements so they could <size=60>murder more of themselves!!!</size>
--
<size=80>What the hell?!</size>
<size=80>F****ng monkeys!!</size>
--
Mother, are you okay? You seem a little bit agitated...
--
Oh wow! They invented the atomic fission! With a little bit of care and ingenuity they can really advance...
--
Aaaaand they are using it to kill each other. 
--
And now every monkey that has one started flinging the atom bombs at the other monkeys.
--
<size=80f>You damn monkeys! Stop behaving like...!</size>
--
...
--
<size=80f>Like a bunch of damn monkeys!</size>
--
...
--
Mother...?
